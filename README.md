# BAMZOOKi AI harness

Lets AI models design BAMZOOKi creatures (Zooks) through an API and test them in the
**real** Bonsai engine, with results returned as data. See
[Documentation/BAMZOOKI_HANDOFF.md](Documentation/BAMZOOKI_HANDOFF.md) for the file formats,
engine findings and roadmap.

Status: M0 (setup and feasibility). The codec and key derivation work; the SDK,
engine runner and MCP server are stubs.

## Bring your own copy: no BBC files or keys in this repo

This repository contains **no** game binaries, scripts, Zooks, meshes, textures, encryption
keys or passwords, and it must never contain any. You need your own installed copy of
BAMZOOKi (Zook Kit v3.1 / Bonsai Engine build 158). At runtime the tools read your install
and derive whatever they need from it: the script key comes from `he.skx`, and the Zook
password from your install's own config script.

Everything extracted or decrypted goes to a gitignored cache (`.cache/bamzooki/` by
default). An asset guard enforces this in pre-commit and CI. It fails if the repo would
contain `.ssx`/`.sax`/`.skx`/`.zook`/`.dff` (and similar) files, any Bonsai archive, or the
password or key derived from your install. Patches to game scripts must be
shipped as diffs or generated code that is applied locally, never as decrypted files.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.11+. Windows runs the engine natively. Linux/macOS will need Wine (not
yet verified).

```sh
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate    Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install                        # enables the asset guard on every commit
cp bamzooki.example.toml bamzooki.toml    # then edit paths (optional on a default Windows install)
```

`bamzooki.toml` is gitignored. Each setting can also be given by an environment variable:

| key            | env var              | meaning                                                         |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `install_dir`  | `BAMZOOKI_INSTALL`   | folder containing `Bonsai.exe` and `he.skx`                      |
| `save_dir`     | `BAMZOOKI_SAVE_DIR`  | per-user save root (Windows: `%APPDATA%\Bamzooki`)              |
| `wine_command` | `BAMZOOKI_WINE`      | launcher prefix on non-Windows, e.g. `["wine"]`                 |
| `cache_dir`    | `BAMZOOKI_CACHE_DIR` | extraction cache and install sandbox (default `.cache/bamzooki`) |

Set `BAMZOOKI_CONFIG` to use a config file somewhere else. If `install_dir` isn't set, the
standard Program Files locations (or the default Wine prefix) are searched.

## Usage

```sh
python tools/extract.py      # decrypt all scripts and decode example Zooks into the cache
python -m pytest             # install-backed tests skip automatically if no install is found
python tools/check_assets.py # run the asset guard by hand
```

## Layout

```
